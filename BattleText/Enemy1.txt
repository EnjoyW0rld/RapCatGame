Enemy:Asher the Smasher
I'm sorry for the tree that produced the oxygen you just wasted! 
All I know is that one of us will win and the other one will be you. 
You sound better with your mouth closed. 
You’re filled with shame, is it cause you got no fame? 
You look like you belong to a museum with other fossils. 
Roses are red, violets are blue. I have 5 fingers and the middle one’s for you. 
Your face would make onions cry. 
I’m so glad you rose, but I’m not sure about your pose. 
Your mum must have been devastated when you were born. 
Is what I see around your mouth foam, rabid cats should stay at home!
