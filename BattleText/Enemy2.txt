Enemy:Smokey Skull
This hood belongs to me! I’m the king, can’t you see?  
I can’t imagine how’s it like to be a copycat, maybe you can tell me! 
You look like you’re about to piss, did your mummy forget your kiss? 
You must be why God created the middle finger.  
If you can’t use slang, you can’t be a part of the gang.  
Your life is so cheap, when you die, your mother won’t even weep! 
Your face should come with a warning sign. 
I can’t with your laziness, being cool is a non-stop business! 
If you looked in a mirror it would break. 
I can see your sweat, go back to your place as a house pet! 
If all mistakes are fixable, why are you still here? 
It’s time for you to learn how to please! First step: get on your knees! 
What? Did you already suffocate, cause I just started my debate! 
You sound like a clown; I think it’s time to back down! 
Do you pay a fee for visual pollution? 
You look like something I drew with my left hand. 
Are you one of those rookies which don’t have any pussies! 
You’ll never be even half the tomcat your mother is. 
We have no place for newbies that don’t even know the hood ABCs! 
Having no rhyme is a Level One crime!
